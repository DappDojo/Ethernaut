Solution

The contract has an address during deployment but is has not been created yet. 
So the contract size is equal to zero. In this situation, extcodesize(caller()) returns 0.

Remember, the xor (^) symbol has precedence over '=='

type(uint64).max == 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
0 - 18446744073709551615;

In hexadecimal: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

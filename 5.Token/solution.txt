To hack this code use the solidity compiler version: 0.6.12

Function transfer is not protected for overflow issues. Just call that function and add a value than is greater than your balance. We can use remix to call the functions.


Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements such as:

if(a + c > a) {
  a = a + c;
}
An easier alternative is to use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library that automatically checks for overflows in all the mathematical operators. The resulting code looks like this:

a = a.add(c);
If there is an overflow, the code will revert.

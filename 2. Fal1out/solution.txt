Solution

In version 6 the constructor should be declared as a function using the same name as the contract. 
In this case the constructor has a typo so the owner is never initialized.

Attack:
1. Retrieve the contract in Remix using your instance address
2. Call the function fal1out()

Done! Now you are the owner. 

Always verify the contract's owner after deploy. Double check the conditions to change the contract's owner.

That was silly wasn't it? Real world contracts must be much more secure than this and so must it be much harder to hack them right?

Well... Not quite.

The story of Rubixi is a very well known case in the Ethereum ecosystem. The company changed its name from 'Dynamic Pyramid' to 'Rubixi' but somehow they didn't rename the constructor method of its contract:

contract Rubixi {
  address private owner;
  function DynamicPyramid() { owner = msg.sender; }
  function collectAllFees() { owner.transfer(this.balance) }
  ...
This allowed the attacker to call the old constructor and claim ownership of the contract, and steal some funds. Yep. Big mistakes can be made in smartcontract

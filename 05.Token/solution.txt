To hack this code use the solidity compiler version: 0.6.12

This issue has been addressed in the Solidity compiler version 0.8.0

Function transfer is not protected against integer overflow issues. 

To hack this level, just call that function and add a value than is 
greater than your balance. You can use remix to call the functions.


Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements such as:

if(a + c > a) {
  a = a + c;
}
An easier alternative is to use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library that automatically checks for overflows in all the mathematical operators. The resulting code looks like this:

a = a.add(c);

If there is an overflow, the code will revert.

Instructions
In this challenge you need to take ownership of the Fallback contract and withdraw the contract's balance.

Attack

The attack is perpetrated in two steps you don't even need to code a smart contract:

1. Call in Remix the function contribute and send less than 0.001 ether.
2. Now that you are registered as a contributor (i.e., contribution greater than zero), then send some ether to the contract.
3. Now you are the owner, call the withdraw function.

Done!

Nothing prevents a contract from receiving ether from a contract that is self destructed.

In solidity, for a contract to be able to receive ether, the fallback function must be marked payable.

However, there is no way to stop an attacker from sending ether to a contract by self destroying. Hence, it is important not to count on the invariant address(this).balance == 0 for any contract logic.

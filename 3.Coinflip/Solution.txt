Randonm number generation in Blockchain is very tricky. 
The lesson here is: do not use blockhashes or timestamps as a source of 
randomness. Remember that all variables are publicly visible including private
variables. Miners have access to this information. 

theres isn't a native way to generate random values, 
implement an orable to generate random numbers. 

In the contract CoinFlipAttack.sol just call the function setValues() 
to obtain the right answer. It is very easy to predict because 
the block.number can be obtained very easily.
